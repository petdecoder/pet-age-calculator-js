# Pet Age Calculator JS 🐶🐱

A lightweight, zero-dependency JavaScript utility to calculate the "human age" of dogs and cats. 

Unlike the old "multiply by 7" rule, this library uses the newer weight-dependent logic supported by veterinary associations.

## Installation

```bash
npm install pet-age-calculator-js
